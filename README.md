### STARTING

#### Description
This is a project I built using pieces from codepen. Each component is from a different codepen project. The front page of the website looks more like a movie website but I was trying to build something from the pieces I saw from codepen. The project was basically about converting an html page to a reactjs page.

#### Stack 
1. Reactjs
2. Html
3. Css
4. Swiper


## REQUIREMNTS
You need to install node


you can download and install node from this link
https://nodejs.org/en/download/

## Steps
step 1 is optional
1. If you don't have reactjs installed on your local machine, you can run the code below to create a reactjs project (if you want to start from scratch)

        'npx create-react-app codependesign'
   
   This will download and install 'create-react-app' with the parent directory name "codependesign"
    
 or
 
2. You can download or clone the github repository. Run the code below to clone the repository
          git clone https://github.com/emmanuelansah247/onlineschool.git
 
 

3. To run the application, run the code below
    'npm start'

4. To build the appliation, run the code below
    'npm run build' 

5. For navigatin, run the following to install react-router-dom
     'npm install react-router-dom'

6. To install swiper, run the following code
      'npm install swiper'


## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
